        <h2> Journey to Geospatial Programming Learning </h2>
        <p> Welcome, learners!This is the very first step of learning programming. 
            To get your hand in geospatial programming, the first step is to go through the basic concepts of programming language. 
            The fundamental blocks of all programming languages are more or less similar. 
            In this article, we will go through the very basic fundamentals things that are required to start our journey to geospatial programming. So let's get started! </p>
        <h3>Data type </h3> 
<p> There are two basic types of data: quantitative, qualitative. Quantitative data is anything we can count, measure, or quantify with numberss. On the other hand, qualitative data represents any information in terms of language or description.
 We can not measure or count it.  For example:  the name of a person is qualitative  data while the age of a person is quantitative data. 
 We express quantitative data by using numbers, and qualitative data by using text or string. </p>

        <h3>Basic data type of programming</h3>

        <p>Apart from number and text, we use another basic types of data in programming languages  that are boolean. Boolean has only two values, true and false. 
        </p>

    
        <h3>Number type data</h3>
        <p>In programming, primarily we use three  basic types of number: integer or whole number, decimal, and float. 
        </p>
        <h3>Integer and decimal</h3>
        <p>All positive,  negative whole numbers including 0 are integers. Briefly, all the whole numbers of the number line are integers. 
            A decimal number is a real number that expresses fractions or whole numbers using a decimal point.
            In a decimal number, the decimal point separates the whole number part from the fractional part. 
                 For example, in the decimal number 3.14, "3" is the whole number part, and "0.14" is the fractional part.
            For example: 1,20, -30, 8,0 all are integers.  On the other hand, 10.34,  10.67 are decimal numbers. 
            Though there are few differences between decimal and float, for the bringing we can consider both as same.</p>
            <h3> String</h3>
            
            <p>In programming, a "string" is a way to handle text or qualitative data. It could be a single word, a sentence, or even a collection of paragraphs. To create a string, we  wrap our text in quotation marks. For example:
            </p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>
var greeting = "Hello"
var sentence = "This is a sample sentence."
</code></pre>
<p>we can combine strings by using the `+` operator:</p>
<pre class="language-js"> <code>
var full_greeting = greeting + " " + sentence
//This would result in: "Hello This is a sample sentence." 
</code></pre>
<p>Strings are just sequences of characters, and we can do basic operations like putting them together or taking parts of them. 
    They are handy for dealing with any kind of <strong> text-related information</strong>  in programming.
    In most programming languages, strings can be written inside either double quotation marks  <code>("string" )</code> , single quotation marks <code>('string')</code>  , 
    or triple quotation marks <code>('''string''' )</code>  depending on the purpose of use and language syntax. Double quotes are commonly used, but using single quotes can be useful when dealing with strings that contain double quotes, and vice versa. 
    Triple quotes are often used for <strong>multiline </strong> strings.</p>

    <h3>Boolean</h3>
    <p>Boolean refers to a data type that can have one of two values: <strong> true</strong>  or <strong> false </strong> .  Boolean values are often used in conditional statements and expressions to make decisions in computer programs. 
    </p>
    <p>Let's think about some examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is it sunny outside?
                <ul> <li> If it is sunny, we can say it's true.</li>
                <li>If it's not sunny, we can say it's false.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do we have a pet?
                <ul><li> If we have a pet, it's true.</li>
                <li>If we don't have a pet, it's false. </li></ul>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>Sometimes the <strong>true</strong>  value represents <strong> 1 </strong>, and the <strong> false </strong> value represents <strong> 0 </strong> .  </p>
        <p> Boolean is like a digital switch that helps computers make decisions. It can be either "on" (true) or "off" (false). Think of it like answering questions with a "yes" or "no."
        </p>
        <h3>Uses of Boolean in Programming</h3>

    <p><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Boolean helps programs decide what to do based on conditions. For example, if it's raining (true), bring an umbrella; otherwise (false), don't.</p>

    <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> It allows us to compare things, like whether one number is bigger than another. For instance, is 10 greater than 5? (true)</p>

    <p><strong>Logical Operation:</strong> Boolean helps express logical relationships. we can say, "I want ice cream AND it's a sunny day," meaning both conditions must be true.</p>

    <p><strong>Looping:</strong> In programming, Boolean is used to repeat tasks until a condition is no longer true. Like eating cookies while we're hungry (true).</p>
<code> Example: 
    Let x = 9, y = 10. Now we will compare if x,  and y have the same value.
    Is x == y?  false  
    </code>


    <h3>Variable</h3>
    <p>A variable is like a storage box in which we can keep different types of information. 
        Imagine it as a labelled container where we can store numbers, words, or other pieces of data. 
        It's associated with a symbolic name and may have a memory address. 
        The name allows referencing the data, and values  can change during execution. 
        To store a separate value, we need to use a separate variable.
         Abstractly, we can say a variable is a <strong>named storage location </strong>  of any kind of data.</p>
         <h3>Declaring a Variable</h3>
         <p>In most programming languages, declaring a variable involves giving it a name and specifying the type of data it will hold. 
            Here's a simple example in Javascript</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>
//Declare a variable named 'age' and assign the value 25 to it
var age = 25
</code></pre>
<p> In this example, <code>'age'</code> is the variable name, and <code>'25'</code>  is the data assigned to it. 
    The keyword <code> "var" </code>  indicates that it’s a variable. There are some other conventions to declare a variable in <strong>Javascript.</strong> 
    In some programming languages we need to specify the data type when declaring a variable. Let’s see an example from <strong>C</strong> programming language: </p>
<pre class="lang-clike"><code>
int a = 8 //the keyword int indicates it will store integer type data 
float = 80.10 //the keyword float indicates it will store float or decimal type data 
char name = "my name" //the keyword char indicates that it will store string or text type data. 
    </code></pre>
    <p>But in <strong> Javascript</strong> or <strong>Python</strong>  we are not required to specify the data type when we declare a variable.
         These programming languages dynamically identify the data type of a variable.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>

    <p>Arithmetic operators are symbols used in programming to perform mathematical calculations on numerical data. They include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Addition (+):</strong> Adds two values together.</li>
        <li><strong>Subtraction (-):</strong> Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplication (*):</strong> Multiplies two values.</li>
        <li><strong>Division (/):</strong> Divides the left operand by the right operand.</li>
        <li><strong>Modulus (%):</strong> <p> The modulus operator (%), when applied to the division of the left operand by the right operand, returns the remainder. 
            For instance, consider the example: <code>var a = 11 % 2 </code>. In this case, the variable  <code>'a'</code>  would be assigned the value 1. 
            This implies that 'a' stores the remainder when 11 is divided by 2. 
            The modulus operator is particularly useful for determining whether a given number is odd or even.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Basic Arithmetic Examples:</h3>

    <p><strong>Addition:</strong> <code> var total = 5 + 3; // total will be 8.</code></p>
    <p><strong>Subtraction:</strong> <code>  var difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6.</code></p>
    <p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> <code> var product = 2 * 6; // product will be 12.</code></p>
    <p><strong>Division:</strong> <code> var quotient = 8 / 2; // quotient will be 4.</code></p>
    <p><strong>Modulus:</strong> <code> var remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder will be 1.</code></p>
    <h3> Adding Comments inside code for Clarity </h3>
    <p>A comment in programming is a piece of text that is not executed as part of the program but is included for human readers to understand the code. 
    Comments provide explanations, notes, or reminders within the code to make it more readable and maintainable.</p>
    <p>How to add comments depends on the programming language. Here is a common examples of commenting:</p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <pre class="language-js"><code> 
    // This is a single-line comment 

    /*
    This is a
    multi-line comment
    */  
    </code></pre>
