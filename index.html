        <h1>What is a Variable?</h1>

        <p>A variable is like a storage box in which you can keep different types of information. Imagine it as a labelled container where you can store numbers, words, or other pieces of data. The name you give to the variable helps you and the computer remember what's inside.</p>

        <h2>Declaring a Variable:</h2>

        <p>In most programming languages, declaring a variable involves giving it a name and specifying the type of data it will hold. Here's a simple example in Python:</p>

        <pre><code># Declare a variable named 'age' and assign the value 25 to it
age = 25
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, <code>age</code> is the variable name, and <code>25</code> is the data assigned to it.</p>

        <h2>Using Variables in Programming:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Storing Information:</strong> Variables let you store different types of information. For instance, you can have a variable called <code>name</code> to store a person's name.</li>

            <pre><code>name = "Alice"</code></pre>

            <li><strong>Changing Values:</strong> Variables are flexible; you can change their values as needed. If Alice has a birthday, you can update her age like this:</li>

            <pre><code>age = 26</code></pre>

            <li><strong>Mathematical Operations:</strong> Variables are handy for calculations. If you want to find the total cost of items, you can use variables for prices and quantities.</li>

            <pre><code>price_per_item = 2.5
quantity = 10
total_cost = price_per_item * quantity</code></pre>

            <li><strong>Readability and Reusability:</strong> Using variables makes your code more readable. Instead of writing the same value multiple times, you can use a variable. If the value changes, you only need to update it in one place.</li>

            <pre class="language-js"><code>tax_rate = 0.08
total_with_tax = total_cost * (1 + tax_rate)</code></pre>

        </ol>
